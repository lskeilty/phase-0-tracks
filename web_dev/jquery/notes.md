Release 0 - how to learn Jquery
1st - google 'how to learn jQuery' and see what comes up
2nd - start exploring, youtube, blogs, articles, etc.
3rd - breaks are important

Stuff to note:
- place <script src="jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script> inside of the <head> </head> tag

- place the downloaded jquery file in the same directory as the pages where you wish to use it

- google and microsoft also host jquery so you don't have to download it, you would include https...jquery/3.2.1... in the script src.

- $(selector).action()
ex: $(this).hide() = hides current element
$("p").hide() = hides all <p> elements
$(".test").hide() = hides all elements with class ="test"
#("#test").hide() = hides the element with id="test"

What worked the best: I am definitely a learn by doing person. Things don't start to click until I try them out myself. W3 schools had some tutorials and I also tried out some of the codecademy tutorials.
