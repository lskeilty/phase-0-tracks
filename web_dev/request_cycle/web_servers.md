Release 2

2. Some key design philosophies of the Linux operating system are that it assumes that the user knows what they're doing. There is a huge amount of power in the hands of the user. I saw it described as 'a hackers operating system'. It is also open sourced, meaning it is free to download, modify, and redistribute.

3. A Virtual Private Server allows a user to remotely create a server on their personal computer. So you can run a server for a website that is hosted thousands (or closer) miles away from your computer's terminal. This is one of the ways to host your website online.

4. Running programs as the root user in Linux is considered 'bad' because it is not very secure. When you are logged in as 'root' possible viruses would have access everywhere. It is recommended to have some sort of pause before implementing big changes, when running root there is no need for further admin priveledges or anything.
