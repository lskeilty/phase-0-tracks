1.) Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

		 3|Kevin Durant|35|Forward|1
		 4|Kyrie Irving|2|Guard|2

2.) Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
	-input:UPDATE teams SET team="Golden State Warriors" WHERE id=1;
	-no output but results are: 1|Golden State Warriors
				    2|Cavaliers

3.) Display the information in both tables using one query.
	-input: SELECT * FROM players, teams WHERE players.team_id = teams.id;

		 5|Draymond Green|23|Forward|1|1|Golden State Warriors

4.) Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
	-input: SELECT players.name, teams.team FROM players JOIN teams ON players.team_id = teams.id;
	-output: Steph Curry|Golden State Warriors
		 LeBron James|Cavaliers
		 Kevin Durant|Golden State Warriors
		 Kyrie Irving|Cavaliers
		 Draymond Green|Golden State Warriors

5.)Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

				2|LeBron James|23|Forward|2
				3|Kevin Durant|35|Forward|1
				5|Draymond Green|23|Forward|1

RELEASE 3
1.) Joins combine columns from one or more tables in databases using common values. You can apply different conditions to a join to change whatâ€™s displayed. The w3 schools webpage on joins has a good diagram.(inner join, left join, right join, full outer join). 

2.) A few diff joins:
	-input: SELECT players.id, teams.team FROM players INNER JOIN teams ON players.team_id = teams.id;
	-output: 1|Golden State Warriors
		 2|Cavaliers
	 	 3|Golden State Warriors
		 5|Golden State Warriors

	-input: SELECT players.name, players.number, players.position, teams.team FROM players LEFT JOIN teams ON players.team_id = teams.id;
	-output: Steph Curry|30|Guard|Golden State Warriors
		 LeBron James|23|Forward|Cavaliers
		 Kevin Durant|35|Forward|Golden State Warriors
		 Draymond Green|23|Forward|Golden State Warriors

	-input: SELECT teams.team, players.name, players.number FROM players JOIN teams ON players.team_id = teams.id;
	-output: Golden State Warriors|Steph Curry|30
		 Cavaliers|LeBron James|23
		 Golden State Warriors|Kevin Durant|35
