- Non-semantic tags (div, span) will help divide code into readable
sections, but the non-semantic elements will tell us nothing about the content.
A <div> tag could contain a wide range of contents. However, a semantic
tag still divides the code into more readable sections, but it also defines the
content (form, table, article). A real life example would be a newspaper having
a sports section then having individual articles in the sports section. So far the ones I have found
useful are the nav, header, and footer. With the newspaper analogy in mind, the
section and article tags are useful as well.

 
 What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
- The browser pretty much uses whichever order the code is in. 1st
lines of code = top of the web page. Last lines of code = bottom of the
webpage. This could change when you change the positioning of the elements with
relative and absolute positioning.

 
 What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later
     date?
- It seems there is a lot to sublime I didn’t know, I’m excited to do a
little more exploring to figure out Sublime’s features. I think I will create
snippets, it seems very useful.


 What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this
     concept?
The most difficult concept was just
the introduction to the new semantic elements. I was previously unfamiliar with
them. But there is a ton of great information on the internet so I’m excited to
look around and learn even more.
